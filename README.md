This is a repo for storing my dotfiles, published with the hope that they can be useful. Different branches contain versions of my dotfiles used on different machines. There is no install script yet - I will get around to using [GNU Stow](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) eventually. For now just read the individual dotfiles and pick out what's useful for you.
